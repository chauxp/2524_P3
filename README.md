# Project 3 ECE 2524
#DirectoryTree_P3.py

##Design:
This project creates a GUI with one's home directory and all it's subdirectories. Clicking on a folder with pop up a new window with that directory as its root. Clicking on a file does not do anything except print to the commmand line. 

##Design Process: 
I created a GUI using tkinter instead of what I had originally planned to use which is a beginners library to use which was graphics.py. I had taken a programming course in the beginning of high school were we used this library, so my knowledge of how to use the library was somewhat elementary and so was my knowledge of python. I decided to go with tkinter to challenge myself as my previous knowledge of python and graphics.py had faded a bit so I wanted to learn something new and more challenging as opposed to reviewing what I'd learned all the way back in high school. It was difficult coming up with a vision for this project because I was just learning tkinter and expanding on my knowledge of python at the same time. So, I wasn't sure what I could do or if I had enough time to do what I wanted. I wanted a gui  interface with more buttons and options, but it was quite hard dealing with my time constraints of balancing this project with my school workload, the business during break, and the amount of which I had to learn. I wanted to use images but finding them on the computer and then displaying them became too time consuming. I had to practice so that I wouldn't start the project cold, but that in turn hurt me when there were specific bugs that I then had to work through. Dealing with all these tkinter objects and trying to have all these buttons try to do multiple things was hard to do. So, I simplified it to have something working to turn it. One thing that I could not get working was the scrollbar to use in large directories where the buttons extend to far down, but I was unable to do it and wasted too much time trying to get it to work. Nonetheless, I am very content with what I've learned and the skills I've aquired dealing with unfamiliar libraries. I tried making it show two subdirectories down but I was unable to figure out the problem as to why they were not showing. I think with a little more time I would implement a renaming tool and a searchbar tool. 
###Libaries Used: 
tkinter, os, functools (just for the partial function)

###Operation Information:
This project uses Linux with a python shell script. Simply running the file DirectoryTree_P3.py with python in the terminal will run the program
